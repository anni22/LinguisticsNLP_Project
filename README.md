# LinguisticsNLP_Project
This is the repository for a project in the course Linguistics in NLP. The project is based on a paper by Joshi et al. (2020), which is a meta-study analyzing the representation of languages in NLP research. We extend the study by including data from the last 5 years and introduce a more accurate methodology. The folder language_taxonomy contains files that relate to the section "The Six Language Classes" in our project paper. The folder Conference_Inclusion relate to the section "Conference-Language Inclusion" in the paper. Please refer to the read-me files inside of the two folders for additional information about the different files.
