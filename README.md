# LinguisticsNLP_Project
This is the repository for a project in the course Linguistics in NLP. The project is based on a paper by Joshi et al. (2020), which is a meta-study analyzing the representation of languages in NLP research. We extend the study by including data from the last 5 years and introduce a more accurate methodology.
